  Your employee isnâ€™t entitled to Statutory Sick Pay because their average weekly earnings must be at least <%= format_money(lower_earning_limit) %>. Their average weekly earnings are <%= format_money(employee_average_weekly_earnings) %>.

You must send them [form SSP1](/government/publications/statutory-sick-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) either:

- within 7 days of them going off sick
- on the 1st normal payday after they go off sick

   They may be able to get [Employment Support Allowance (ESA)](/employment-support-allowance).

  Your employee isn’t entitled to Statutory Sick Pay because they’ve already received the maximum amount of SSP (28 weeks).

  You must send them [form SSP1](/government/publications/statutory-sick-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) either:

- within 7 days of them going off sick
- on the 1st payday after they return to work 

They may be able to get [Employment Support Allowance (ESA)](/employment-support-allowance).
